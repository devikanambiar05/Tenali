## 1. Product Overview

### Vision
Tenali exists to shift math learning from passive memorization to interactive discovery. It is not merely an assessment tool; it is a living, breathing learning world where mastering mathematical concepts builds a student's personal learning identity.

### Problem Statement
Standard ed-tech platforms serve flat, repetitive MCQ drills that encourage guessing and offer no step-by-step diagnostic feedback. Because there is no progress tracking, personalization, or persistent rewards, students experience cognitive overload and have no intrinsic motivation to return to the site the next day.

---

## 2. Target Users & Personas

* **Taittiriya (Student, Age 10–12)**: Needs high visual feedback, micro-rewards (coins/avatars), and gentle scaffolding to avoid math anxiety.
* **Tatsavit (Student, Age 13–16)**: Preparing for board exams (CBSE/ICSE) where step-wise marks are awarded. Needs step-by-step diagnostic feedback to target specific weak spots.
* **Classroom Teacher**: Wants to manage student cohorts and see consistency/effort rankings without creating high-pressure environments.
* **Parent**: Desires periodic, high-level digests showing where their child is struggling or succeeding, without micro-surveilling their screen time.

---

## 3. Success Metrics & Roadmap

### Success Metrics
* **Engagement**: Weekly active streak retention rate.
* **Concept Mastery**: The ratio of completed Stage 3 (Mastery) topics relative to starts.
* **Scaffolding Efficacy**: Decrease in student error rates on checkable steps after triggering a step-wise diagnostic walkthrough.

### In Scope
* 69 math and verbal topics with adaptive generation.
* Localized localStorage persistence for theme and progression state.
* Core interactive avatar customizing panel and coin rules.
* Dijkstra-based prerequisite journey planner.

### Out of Scope
* Video streaming or video-based lectures.
* Real-time synchronous multiplayer games (lobbying is asynchronous/cohort-scoped).
* Real-time active screen surveillance dashboards for parents.

## 6. Core Technical Logic (Stateless Math Generator)

### Stateless Math Generator
Except for static GK/Vocab JSON assets loaded into memory at server startup, the server dynamically generates math questions on every `GET /<type>-api/question` request using randomized multipliers. The difficulty parameter (0 = Easy, 1 = Medium, 2 = Hard, 3 = Extra Hard) drives the numeric ranges (e.g. `digitRange` or `quadraticRange`).

### Express Solve Middleware
Intercepts all `POST *-api/check` endpoints. If `req.body.solve === true`, the middleware intercepts and monkey-patches `res.json` to attach a step-by-step markdown-based explanation generated dynamically by `generateExplanation()`.

---

## 7. Existing 69 Puzzle Types Registry

The application supports the following 69 distinct topics mapped inside `modeMap` and serving GET/POST API endpoints:
- **Arithmetic**: `addition`, `basicarith`, `multiply`, `decimals`, `fractionadd`, `percent`, `ratio`, `rounding`, `sqrt`, `squaring`
- **Number Theory**: `hcflcm`, `primefactor`, `bases`
- **Algebra**: `indices`, `surds`, `lineareq`, `quadratic`, `qformula`, `simul`, `funceval`, `lineq`, `polymul`, `polyfactor`, `sequences`, `ineq`, `binomial`, `remfactor`, `variation`, `stdform`, `bounds`, `log`, `complex`
- **Geometry**: `trig`, `invtrig`, `coordgeom`, `angles`, `triangles`, `congruence`, `pythag`, `polygons`, `similarity`, `circleth`, `bearings`, `mensur`, `heron`, `circmeasure`, `conics`, `transform`, `section`
- **Calculus**: `diff`, `integ`, `limits`, `diffeq`
- **Statistics & Probability**: `prob`, `stats`, `permcomb`
- **Vectors & Matrices**: `matrix`, `vectors`, `dotprod`
- **Applied Math**: `sdt`, `profitloss`, `shares`, `banking`, `gst`, `linprog`
- **Other**: `gk`, `vocab`, `spot` (Twin Hunt), `tatsavit` (9-level drill)

## Feature A: Tenali Learning Framework (TLF v1.0)

### Description
Every lesson is structured as a short learning journey rather than a sequence of flat questions. It introduces concepts one step at a time, minimizing cognitive load and promoting active visual prediction.

### Functional Requirements
* **FR-A1**: The lesson player must structure lessons into a linear sequence of steps mapping to the 13 TLF components:
  1. *Ever Wondered?* (Curiosity hook question)
  2. *Why This Matters* (One-sentence utility justification)
  3. *Today's Mission* (Checklist of objectives)
  4. *Quick Recall* (1–2 ungraded prerequisite review questions)
  5. *Prediction* (Ungraded hypothesis question; no marks)
  6. *Learn One Small Idea* (Concept slide fitting on a single screen)
  7. *Guided Example* (A simple step-by-step worked problem)
  8. *Try It* (1–3 practice questions immediately following the idea)
  9. *Checkpoint* (Visual indicator celebrating milestones)
  10. *Challenge* (Independent quiz using Tenali's algorithmic question generator)
  11. *Tenali's Tidbit* (Under 40-word fun history or real-world trivia)
  12. *Reflection* (Self-reflective questions e.g. "What pattern did you notice?")
  13. *Mission Complete* (Summary screen unlocking the next lesson)
* **FR-A2**: The interface must support four core flows:
  * **Discovery-Heavy**: Focuses on *Ever Wondered*, *Prediction*, *Learn*, *Question*, *Learn*, *Challenge*.
  * **Skill-Heavy**: Focuses on *Quick Recall*, *Mission*, *Learn*, *Guided Practice*, *Challenge*, *Reflection*.
  * **Revision**: Focuses on *Mission*, *Quick Recall*, *Challenge*, *Reflection*, *Tidbit*.
  * **Puzzle**: Focuses on *Puzzle*, *Student Guesses*, *Reveal*, *Practice*, *Hard Puzzle*.

### Validation
* Lesson flow configuration objects must contain at least three stages.

### Errors
* **400 Bad Request**: If a lesson payload lacks mandatory steps or uses unregistered components.

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Scenario: A student starts a fractions lesson in Discovery-heavy mode
  Given the student selects the fractions lesson
  When the lesson starts
  Then the student is presented with the "Ever Wondered" question: "Can two people both get more than half of a pizza?"
  And no feedback or grade is recorded for their answer at this stage.
```

## Feature B: Step-Wise Diagnostic Solving & Concept Visuals

### Description
Trains students in the CBSE/ICSE step-marking style. Instead of displaying a static correct answer when a student fails a multi-step problem, the system breaks the question down into its sub-components, checking the student's work step-by-step.

### Functional Requirements
* **FR-B1**: Multi-step questions (defined as questions with >= 2 decision points) must enter **Diagnostic Mode** on the student's first incorrect submission.
* **FR-B2**: In Diagnostic Mode, the primary question text is replaced by a sequence of sub-step inputs.
* **FR-B3**: The system must check each step instantly:
  * If correct: Enable input for the next step.
  * If incorrect: Display the correct working/method for *that step only*, then let the user proceed to the next step.
* **FR-B4**: After all steps are solved or corrected, display the full start-to-finish recap.
* **FR-B5**: The overall question must still be scored as **Incorrect** (preventing users from laundering errors into a passed grade).

### Validation
* Step inputs must accept decimal values, fractional slashes (/), negative signs, and variable x.

### Errors
* **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Invalid characters or syntax in formula inputs.

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Scenario: Student enters incorrect answer on a 2-step algebraic equation
  Given the student is solving "3(x + 2) = 21"
  When they submit the incorrect answer "5"
  Then the input box disappears and step-wise inputs are displayed
  And Step 1 asks the student to expand: "3x + 6 = ?"
```

## Feature S: Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Adaptive Engine

Source: PersonalExam (SRIBD, 2024) + Khan Academy + Carnegie Learning

What it does: Replaces the simple "3 correct answers = advance" rule with a probabilistic model. Uses a 4-parameter Hidden Markov Model to estimate the probability that a student truly knows a concept — accounting for lucky guesses and careless mistakes (slips).

**Parameters:**
- `P(L₀) = 0.1` — Initial knowledge probability
- `P(T) = 0.3` — Learning probability per attempt
- `P(G) = 0.2` — Guessing probability
- `P(S) = 0.1` — Slip probability
- **Mastery threshold: P(Lₙ) ≥ 0.95**

**How it works:**

After a correct answer:
```
P(Known | Correct) = P(Known) × (1 - P(Slip)) / [P(Known) × (1 - P(Slip)) + (1 - P(Known)) × P(Guess)]
```

After each observation, learning transition is applied:
```
P(Lₙ) = P(Kₙ) + (1 - P(Kₙ)) × P(Transit)
```

**Why it matters:** A student who gets 3 easy questions right by guessing should NOT be advanced. BKT estimates *true mastery* with 95% confidence before progression. This is the same algorithm used by Khan Academy and Carnegie Learning's Cognitive Tutor.

**Implementation:** `updateBKT()`, `loadBKTState()`, `saveBKTState()` functions in `App.jsx`. Mastery persists across sessions via `localStorage`. Every quiz app (69 types) now uses BKT-based adaptive scoring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Difficulty only advances when P(Lₙ) ≥ 0.95
- [x] A lucky guesser is not prematurely promoted
- [x] Mastery state persists across browser sessions
- [x] All 69 quiz types use BKT scoring

## Feature T: Dyslexia-Friendly & Low-Vision Interface

Source: British Dyslexia Association (BDA) Style Guide + WCAG 2.1 AA + NCF 2022 Inclusive Education

What it does: Adds an accessibility toggle in settings that activates a dyslexia-friendly reading mode:

**Visual changes when activated:**
- Font switches to **OpenDyslexic** (free, open-source font designed for dyslexic readers)
- Line spacing increases to **1.8** (BDA recommendation)
- Letter spacing increases to **0.12em**
- Background shifts to a **soft cream (#FDF6E3)** to reduce visual stress
- Key numbers and operators in questions are **color-highlighted** for scannability
- Font size increases by **20%** globally

**Low-vision enhancements:**
- High-contrast mode option (pure black on white, or white on black)
- Minimum touch target size of **44×44px** (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements

**Why it matters:**
1. **Prevalence:** 5–10% of the global population has dyslexia. In a class of 40, that's 2–4 students who struggle to read standard fonts.
2. **India context:** India's NEP 2020 and NCF 2022 mandate inclusive education. Dyslexia often goes undiagnosed, leading to students being labeled "poor at math" when the issue is reading, not reasoning.
3. **Simple implementation:** This is purely a CSS/font change — zero impact on quiz logic. Maximum accessibility gain for minimum engineering effort.
4. **Compliance:** Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for text readability and contrast.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Accessibility toggle in settings panel
- [ ] OpenDyslexic font loaded and applied when active
- [ ] Line spacing, letter spacing, and font size adjustments
- [ ] Cream background or high-contrast mode
- [ ] All touch targets ≥ 44×44px
- [ ] Preference persists across sessions

## Feature U: i18n Multilingual Interface

Source: NEP 2020 (Mother Tongue Instruction) + NCF 2022 (Multilingual Education)

What it does: Adds Hindi translations for question prompts, hints, feedback text, and UI labels. Students can toggle between English and Hindi at any time.

**Example:**
- English: "What is the HCF of 24 and 36?"
- Hindi: "24 और 36 का म.स.प. क्या है?"

**Phase 1 scope:** UI chrome (buttons, labels, instructions) in Hindi. Question prompts for the 15 most popular quiz types.

**Why it matters:** NEP 2020 explicitly mandates instruction in the mother tongue up to at least Class 5, and recommends it through Class 8. **Hindi is spoken by 57% of India's population.** A student who struggles with English but understands fractions perfectly should not be penalized by a language barrier.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Language toggle (EN / हिन्दी) in header
- [ ] UI labels and instructions translated
- [ ] Question prompts for 15+ quiz types in Hindi
- [ ] Language preference persists across sessions

## 7. Pillar 4 — Learning Efficiency & Analytics

> *"Maximize learning in minimum time."*

---

## Feature V: Session Time Optimizer & Study Planners

Source: Pomodoro Technique + Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) + Duolingo session design

What it does: When a student opens Tenali, they can optionally set a study duration: "I have 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 minutes." The system then builds an optimal session plan that maximizes learning:

**Session structure:**
1. **Warm-up (10%):** 2–3 review questions from previously mastered topics (spaced repetition)
2. **Core practice (75%):** New questions at the ZPD difficulty, prioritized by topics with lowest mastery
3. **Cool-down (15%):** Summary of what was learned, topics improved, and preview of next session

**Smart prioritization uses:**
- BKT mastery scores → Focus on topics with mastery < 0.5
- Spaced repetition schedule → Include topics due for review
- Error recovery rates → Revisit topics where the student struggled
- Elo ratings → Select questions at ~50% expected success

**Why it matters:**
1. **Time is scarce:** Indian students have limited study time alongside school, tuition, and homework. Wasting 30 minutes on already-mastered topics is unacceptable.
2. **Cognitive Load Theory:** Starting with easy warm-up questions activates prior knowledge (Sweller, 1988). Ending with a summary triggers the "testing effect" for better consolidation.
3. **Duolingo model:** Duolingo's 5-minute daily sessions are optimized for maximum retention — same principle, applied to math.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Time selector on quiz start screen (15/30/45/60 min)
- [ ] Warm-up phase with review questions
- [ ] Core phase prioritizes low-mastery topics
- [ ] Cool-down phase summarizes session progress
- [ ] Session ends gracefully when time is up (not mid-question)
